      <p>If you have questions about an upcoming trip, you've come to the right place! Here you'll find <a href="resources/faq.html">FAQ</a>'s for each of our tour packages, answers to general tour questions, and some <a href="resources/links.html">tour information</a> that can help you plan your trips. You'll also find our <a href="resources/legal.html">privacy</a> and legal mumbo-jumbo that helps explain the <a href="explorers/join.html">terms</a> of our site, and our tours. If you have any additional questions, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us.</p>

      <h2>General Tour Information</h2>

      <h3>Customer notifications</h3>
      <p>When you book a tour with Explore California, you should receive two notifications via email. The first will be a <strong>tour confirmation</strong>, which states that your tour is booked, gives you the dates of your tour, and lists all amenities included in your package. The second notification should arrive two weeks prior to the start of your tour. This will be a <strong>reminder notification</strong> and will contain your tour dates and current tour conditions, if applicable. <em>If you do not receive a confirmation within 24 hours, or the reminder notification two weeks out, contact us immediately</em>. We’ll make sure there are no problems in the system and confirm your tour.</p>

      <h3>Tour vouchers</h3>
      <p>Some tour packages include tour vouchers. These tour vouchers allow you to participate in optional activities during a tour and are usually scheduled for downtime or as an optional choice to replace the day’s featured activity. The vouchers are only good during the tour and have no cash value, and cannot be redeemed if the tour is not taken. The tour vouchers are negotiated with 3rd party vendors. Although Explore California monitors these vendors closely, we cannot guarantee that scheduled activities will take place.</p>

      <h3>Trip planning</h3>
      <p>After registration, you will be sent a PDF trip planning document specific to your tour. In the Trip Planner we offer packing advice, places of interest along the tour route, a historical and environmental overview of the tour, a list of any required equipment for the tour that is <em>not</em> provided by Explore California, and additional resources for researching the surrounding area and points of interest included in your tour. Additional information about specific tours can be found in our FAQ section.</p>

    <h3>Tour checklist</h3>
